# Rusty Sandbox
A lightweight sandbox sim written in Rust.

This is a quick hobby project written to practice three things: Rust, [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/) and Maths!

## Developer Installation

Pre-requisites: The Rust toolchain (stable preferred) and well... git!
```
git clone https://github.com/JSKitty/rusty-sandbox.git
cargo run --release
cargo build --release
```

## Aim / Goals

The primary aims of the project being:
- **Minimalistic codebase:** easy to follow, easy to learn from, a 'living' tutorial.
- **Low Dependency:** as much written in-house as possible, such as physics algorithms, etc.
- **Lightweight:** should compile super fast, and execute super fast by users.
- **Fun:** should be pretty fun to play with! Both in code and in user-land.
